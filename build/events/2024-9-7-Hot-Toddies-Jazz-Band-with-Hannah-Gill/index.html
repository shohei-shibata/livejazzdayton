<p>THE HOT TODDIES JAZZ BAND are a fun-loving hot jazz &amp; swing band from NYC. They have an eclectic mix of styles perfect for dancing, lindy hop, and good times!</p>
<p>The band has quickly become one of the top swing bands on the scene in NYC, the birthplace of the dance. They most recently headlined the beloved outdoor swing dance at Lincoln Center in front of over 2,000 people during “Summer for the City” (formerly Midsummer Night Swing) on July 6, 2023. This also was the pre-release of their debut full length album which came out on July 28th on all digital platforms. The album was not only praised by critics, but was on the Jazz Charts for 4 weeks, hitting #11 on the NACC Top 30 Jazz Chart, and playing on over 50 radio stations nationwide.</p>
<p>Additionally they perform at top venues around town such as The Blue Note Jazz Club, The Plaza Hotel, The Whitney Museum, The Public, The Players Club, The Montauk Club, and The Standard, among others. Their acclaimed weekly residency at GOTHAM JAZZ started in May 2022 at remains strong at the popular nightclub, Somewhere Nowhere, often pulling 300-400 guests per night. They also have performed at Prohibition Production’s sold-out Mardi Gras, Mad Hatter’s Ball and Gotham Jazz Festival; International Lindy Hop Championships “After Party”(ILHC 2022), the Cornell University Swing Weekend in 2022-2024, The Back Room (NYC’s last Prohibition-era speakeasy), among others. On tour they’ve played at Glen Echo Park in Washington DC with Gottaswing, the Avalon Theater in Maryland, and The 2022 Mexican International Hot Jazz Festival.</p>
<p>The band also plays at exclusive private, holiday &amp; corporate events for clients such as The Whitney Museum, BizBash, Nice Ltd, The Red Cross, The Public Hotel, BNI, St Johns University, Mann Investments, and VIP nightclub openings for Somewhere Nowhere and Elsie Rooftop.</p>
<p>With the release of The Hot Toddies’ 2021 debut EP, their wacky music videos for “Dunkin Bagel” and “Five O’clock Coffee” both hit over 100k views on Facebook, while the band also has several videos with over 10k views on YouTube. The group often plays as a sextet or septet, often with one or two singers, and can comfortably become a larger or smaller size ensemble as needed.</p>
<p>Co-founded by Grammy-nominated GABE TERRACCIANO (Turtle Island String Quartet, Avalon Jazz Band) and noted composer &amp; producer PATRICK SOLURI (Prohibition Productions), the band features some of the top musicians in the swing &amp; jazz worlds including JUSTIN POINDEXTER (Jazz at Lincoln Center), DAN LEVINSON (Mel Torme, Woody Allen, The Aviator, Boardwalk Empire), RON WILKINS (Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Dizzy Gilespie), plus noted vocalists QUEEN ESTHER (James “Blood” Ulmer), and HANNAH GILL (Postmodern Jukebox, Company XIV), as well as special guest pianist GORDON WEBSTER.</p>
