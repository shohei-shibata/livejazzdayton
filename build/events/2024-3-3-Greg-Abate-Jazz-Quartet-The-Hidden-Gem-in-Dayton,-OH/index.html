<p>International jazz/recording Greg Abate comes to The Hidden Gem Music Club in Dayton, OH Matt Cooper on piano, Chris Berg on bass, and Lee McKinney on the drums.</p>
<p>Greg Abate jazz saxophonist, flutist, composer continues with 225 days a year touring the globe. In the mid 70’s after finishing a four year program at Berklee College Of Music, Greg played lead alto for the Ray Charles Orchestra for 2 years. In 1978 Greg formed his group Channel One which was a favorite in the New England area and from there had the opportunity to play tenor sax with the revived Artie Shaw Orchestra under leadership of Dick Johnson from 1986 to ’87.</p>
<p>Following this experience Greg ventured out as post hard bop soloist playing Jazz Festivals, Jazz Societies and Jazz Clubs throughout the U.S. Canada and abroad, including most of Europe, UK, and Moscow and Georgia Russia. Greg’s newest release Gratitude, with the Tim Ray Trio has received glowing reviews and a lot of international airplay. Also, check out Greg's other recordings including special guests Phil Woods and other notable artists.</p>
<p>Greg is currently a Whaling City Sound recording artist. Greg recorded his first CD Live At Birdland NYC in 1991 on the Candid Jazz Label with the trio of James Williams, Rufus Reid and Kenny Washington. To this date Greg has recorded over 17 other recordings as leader.</p>
<p>Greg is also an adjunct professor of Jazz Studies at Rhode Island College and is also a very active jazz clinician with co. sponsorship from the Conn-Selmer Instrument Co., conducting workshops and master classes through the U.S and abroad.</p>
<p>Greg has been inducted into the RI MUSIC HALL OF FAME 2016</p>
<p>Performer, author, educator and clinician, Matt Cooper is one of the busiest and most versatile keyboardists in the Inland Northwest. His performances range from jazz and blues to chamber music recitals and concertos. Author of a groundbreaking book on Duke Ellington’s piano styles, he performs on acoustic and digital piano, Hammond organ, Hohner melodica and accordion. Ranging from straight ahead jazz to blues, funk and bluegrass, as well as traditional recitals of classical and new music, he is in demand as a performer and adjudicator throughout the Northwest and beyond.</p>
