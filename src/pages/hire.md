title: Live Jazz for Your Event
---

Live jazz music is an intimate experience that makes a space feel truly special. It can be a jazz trio that whispers in the background while your guests enjoy a drink and a conversation. Or it can be a powerful big band that gets everyone on their feet, dancing the night away. 

Do you run a business, like a bar or a cafe? Then you might want to seriously consider having a live jazz band to give your customers another great reason to keep coming back!

Are you planning a private event? A live jazz band might be just what you need to make it unforgetable. 

Whether you're serious about hiring a live jazz band or you are just curious, I am here to help. I not only perform as a part of my jazz trio or as a part of other groups, but I can also connect you with the other super talented jazz musicians in the Dayton area.

All you have to do is to send me a message via the [contact form](/contact), and we can start a conversation.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
