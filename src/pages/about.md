Thanks for stopping by! Live Jazz Dayton is my little project that I started to help people like you to find all the great live jazz events around Dayton, Ohio. I hope you're finding it to be useful!

Beside this website and the [email newsletter](https://buttondown.email/livejazzdayton), you can also find LJD on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/livejazzdayton) and on the [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@livejazzdayton)

If you're looking to hire a live jazz band, whether its for your business or private events, I would love to help! Go [HERE](/hire) to learn more.

Finally, if you enjoy this website or the newsletter... please consider making a donation! You can do so by going to [Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/shohei_shibata). It would help me pay for the tools needed to manage this website. I would very much appreciate it!

Hope to see you at a live jazz event in the near future.

Take care,

Shohei Shibata
