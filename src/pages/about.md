Thanks for stopping by! I'm Shohei, the creator and the manager of this website. You might also finding me on the stage playing drums now and then.

I created this website to help *you* find all the great live jazz events around Dayton, Ohio. 

If you would like to receive the event listing via email, subscribe to my newsletter [here](https://buttondown.email/livejazzdayton). Each week on Thursdays I send out an email containing the upcoming events, along with any annoucements if there are any.

Are you thinking about creating a website for yourself or your business? I'd love to talk with you about that, and see if I might be able to help! Head over to the [contact form](/contact) and send me a message!

Finally, if you enjoy this website or the newsletter... please consider making a donation! You can do so by going to [Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/shohei_shibata).

Hope to see you at a live jazz event in the near future.

Take care,

Shohei Shibata
