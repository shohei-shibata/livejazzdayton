Fall is upon us but you can still enjoy some hot Big Band Jazz with the DJO at the Hidden Gem Music Club in Centerville. We had a great crowd in August and are hoping to have all of you back for some swingin' Big Band Jazz on Sunday, September 18th at 7:00 PM!!! Bring your family and friends down to the club for a wonderful evening of music!!! We will have John Harner on Trumpet along with Debra Hunter on vocals. Cover is only $5!!! The Hidden Gem is located at 507 Miamisburg-Centerville Rd, Centerville, OH 45459.

PS, Bring your dancing shoes!

See you there!!!
